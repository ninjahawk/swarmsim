## Model Summary
Charbonneau Chapter 10. N agents on a periodic 2D unit square [0,1]^2.
Each agent subject to 4 forces per timestep:
- Repulsion: pushes agents apart within range 2*r0
- Flocking: aligns velocity with neighbors within range rf
- Self-propulsion: drives agent toward target speed v0
- Random: uniform noise in [-ramp, ramp]

Forward Euler integration at dt=0.01. Periodic boundaries via ghost agent buffer zone.
Default parameters: N=350, r0=0.005, eps=0.1, rf=0.1, alpha=1.0, v0=1.0, mu=10.0, ramp=0.5

Order parameter: Phi = |mean(v_hat)|, ranges 0 (random) to 1 (perfect alignment)

## Finding 1: Equilibrium speed is v_eq = v0 + alpha/mu
**What:** Agents don't cruise at v0 -- they cruise at v_eq = v0 + alpha/mu.
**Why:** When the flock aligns, the flocking force always pushes agents forward
at magnitude alpha. Self-propulsion equilibrates at a higher speed to compensate.
**Evidence:** With alpha=1, mu=10, v0=1 -> measured mean speed 1.098 vs predicted 1.100 (diff=0.002).
Verified across alpha = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 -- all match v0 + alpha/mu to within 0.002.
**Implication:** v0 and alpha cannot be set independently without affecting cruise speed.
To target a specific cruise speed v_cruise, set v0 = v_cruise - alpha/mu.

## Finding 2: Solid-to-fluid phase transition in repulsion-only system
**What:** With only repulsion and noise (alpha=0, v0=0), KE rises continuously with noise
amplitude eta. Transition appears continuous (not abrupt) across eta ~ 1-10.
**Evidence:** Sweep A in analysis.py, 5 seeds each with error bars.
eta=0.5: KE=0.00 | eta=3: KE=0.16 | eta=10: KE=1.74 | eta=30: KE=15.89
**Visual:** At low eta, agents form hexagonal crystal (close-packed). At high eta, fluid phase.
**Open question:** Is this a true phase transition or a crossover? Would need to look for
diverging susceptibility or correlation length to answer.

## Finding 3: Low threshold for flock formation
**What:** Flock forms (Phi > 0.5) at very small flocking amplitude alpha -- around alpha ~ 0.05-0.1.
**Evidence:** Sweep B in analysis.py, 5 seeds each.
alpha=0: Phi=0.088 | alpha=0.05: Phi=0.404 | alpha=0.10: Phi=0.607 | alpha=0.20: Phi=0.891
**Note:** Large variance at alpha=0.05-0.10 (std ~0.12-0.19) -- near the transition the outcome
is sensitive to initial conditions. Above alpha~0.2 the flock reliably forms.

## Finding 4: Full model robust to noise up to eta~10
**What:** With all forces active (default parameters), Phi stays near 1.0 up to eta~10,
then drops sharply, collapsing to Phi~0.4 at eta=20.
**Evidence:** Sweep C in analysis.py, 5 seeds each.
eta=1: Phi=0.999 | eta=5: Phi=0.976 | eta=10: Phi=0.906 | eta=20: Phi=0.417
**Contrast:** Repulsion-only system (Finding 2) doesn't form a flock at all.
The flocking force makes the system much more resistant to noise disruption.

## Finding 5: Flocking maintains coherence under predator pressure
**What:** Under predator pressure, flocking prey maintain Phi~1.0 throughout the simulation.
Non-flocking prey (alpha=0) scatter to Phi~0.1 almost immediately.
**Evidence:** Exp 2 in predator.py, 10 seeds each.
- Flocking: steady-state Phi = 0.998, mean predator-nearest distance = 0.112
- Non-flocking: steady-state Phi = 0.096, mean distance = 0.127
**Interpretation:** The flock absorbs the predator's pressure without breaking apart.
Non-flocking agents are marginally farther from the predator individually, but they have
no collective structure. Flocking sacrifices some individual distance for group cohesion.

---

## Finding 6: Flock coherence robust to predator aggression
**What:** Prey flock Phi stays near 0.95-0.98 across all tested predator aggression levels
(alpha_pred = 0 to 15, effective speeds 0.05 to 1.55). Flock does not break apart.
**Evidence:** Exp 3 in predator.py, 8 seeds each.
**Evidence:** Predator-flock distance drops from 0.24 (passive predator) to ~0.10
(alpha_pred >= 1) and then saturates -- the flock successfully holds the predator
at a minimum distance regardless of how fast the predator is.
**Interpretation:** There is an evasion floor. The collective repulsion response is enough
to maintain a fixed buffer distance even against a very aggressive predator.

## Finding 7: Dilution effect -- larger flocks expose smaller fractions
**What:** The fraction of the flock within predator threat range decreases with flock size.
**Evidence:** Exp 4 in predator.py, 5 seeds each.
N=10: fraction~0.49 | N=25: ~0.21 | N=50: ~0.19 | N=100: ~0.11 | N=200: ~0.14
**Interpretation:** Basic geometric dilution -- predator occupies a fixed area, larger
flock has more agents outside that area. Consistent with the biological "safety in numbers"
hypothesis. Note: N=200 slightly worse than N=100 (0.14 vs 0.11), possibly noise.

## Open Questions / Next Directions
1. Is the solid-to-fluid transition (Finding 2) a true phase transition? Look for
   diverging susceptibility or finite-size scaling.
2. Does the evasion floor (Finding 6) depend on prey flocking amplitude alpha?
   Predict: stronger flocking = better collective evasion response.
3. Do arched/splitting flock shapes emerge as the book predicts? Need to characterize
   flock geometry (radius of gyration, aspect ratio) not just Phi.
4. What happens with multiple predators? Does the flock strategy change?
5. Can we reproduce the book's Fig 10.6 vortex structure and study its stability?
